    <para>
        Jini is a technology for implementing Service Oriented Architectures
        based on the concept of Java proxies to services.  The fundamental idea
        is that service consumers are implemented in Java.  In order to use a service, 
        the consumer loads a serialized proxy from a lookup service, or Registrar.
    </para>
    <para>
        Since the proxy is loaded using Java dynamic class loading, it can implement
        any protocol required by the service implementation.  As a result, Jini services
        do not depend on any particular protocol, and each service is free to 
        choose a protocol and implementation options that suit the service.
