River Container Hierarchical State Machine
==========================================

Introduction
------------

A Hierarchical (or Harel) State Machine is a useful construct in many 
asynchronous event-driven scenarios.  This library is an implementation of
a hierarchical state machine that was designed for the application startup
component of the Apache River Container
but may also be useful for other things, so it's broken out into a separate 
library.

machine implementation used in various places in the container.
